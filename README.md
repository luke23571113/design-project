# Circles 







## Notes:

Creating a social media app that focuses on meaningful interactions, not just short dopamine inducing videos. 
Basically a minimalistic social media app, that DOESN'T try to draw the user in forever.

- optimally black and white, not sure how videos would work tho ... 
- minimal user information stored ... name, school.
    - or, each user could have a personal QR code changing every day, so that to follow someone new, you actually need to meet them in person ...

- There is no way to reach people outside of your circle. but peopel in ur circle can post text, photos, video.
