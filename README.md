# Circles 

## Introduction:
Circles is a minimalist social media app, designed to reinforce meaningful connections rather than to draw you into a dopamine trap. The target audience would be anyone wanting a detox from the instant dopamine rush that other social media platforms offer. 

## Value/Use:
Current social media apps are limitless, but that's not necessarily a good thing. They don't restrict the amount of videos we watch, and they collect endless amounts of data on us. An app like Circles is useful for basically anyone who wants a detox from normal social media, but doesn't want to lose its benefits. 

## User Interaction and Experience:
First, the entire app will be black and white. There will be an option to toggle whether or not you want the photos and videos you see to be black and white as well. Rather than creating an endless scrolling home page (like TikTok or Instagram), my current idea for the UI is a tree. You're the node at the center, and your immediate connections are only one level away from you. Mutuals will be two levels away, and the mutuals mutuals will be three levels away, etc. The main setting of the app is controlling how many "levels" you want to see, effectively creating a "circle" of friends and people you know. You will not be able to see ANY CONTENT outside of the people in your circle. 

## Competitive Element:
Of course, this is still a social media app. Even though accounts aren't viewable by anyone, anyone in your "circle" would be able to see your account. This facilitiates competition by encouraging people to expand their circle and establish new relationships. 

## Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies: 
Well uh ... it's meant to not be addictive. Ideally, you should never be drawn into this app. Anytime while using it, you should be able to just put the phone down no problem. But for engagement, I think a really nice black and white user interface will make people want to spend more time on the app. 

## Scalabiliy and Expansion:
Since it's a social media app, it will be very easy to scale. 

## Accessibility and Inclusivity: 
I mean anyone will be able to make an account, so we are not restricting anyone using this app in any way. 

## Notes for myself:

Creating a social media app that focuses on meaningful interactions, not just short dopamine inducing videos. 
Basically a minimalistic social media app, that DOESN'T try to draw the user in forever.

- optimally black and white, not sure how videos would work tho ... 
- minimal user information stored ... name, school.
    - or, each user could have a personal QR code changing every day, so that to follow someone new, you actually need to meet them in person ...

- There is no way to reach people outside of your circle. but peopel in ur circle can post text, photos, video.
